Insert/Delete-based Text Style Transfer with non-autoregressive parallel decoding
===

This repository hosts a small project for Text Style Transfer. We used [KERMIT: Generative Insertion-Based Modeling for Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01604), an insertion-based pretrained model and fine-tune it on text style transfer corpus. This model also learns to delete attribution words (as the method proposed in [Transforming Delete, Retrieve, Generate Approach for Controlled Text Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09368). Full training flow is shown below:
